    pImage - Pointer to the input/output image
    uiXRes - Image resolution in the X direction
    uiYRes - Image resolution in the Y direction
    Min - Minimum greyvalue of input image (also becomes minimum of output image)
    Max - Maximum greyvalue of input image (also becomes maximum of output image)
    uiNrX - Number of contextial regions in the X direction (min 2, max uiMAX_REG_X)
    uiNrY - Number of contextial regions in the Y direction (min 2, max uiMAX_REG_Y)
    uiNrBins - Number of greybins for histogram ("dynamic range")
    float fCliplimit - Normalized cliplimit (higher values give more contrast)
  The number of "effective" greylevels in the output image is set by uiNrBins; selecting
  a small value (eg. 128) speeds up processing and still produce an output image of
  good quality. The output image will have the same minimum and maximum value as the input
  image. A clip limit smaller than 1 results in standard (non-contrast limited) AHE.
